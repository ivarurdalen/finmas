# Configuration

The default parameters of the app can be set up in the [config.yaml](https://github.com/ivarurdalen/finmas/blob/main/config.yaml)

Some of the most important parameters are explained here:

- **Embedding model**: An embedding model can be set for the news data and the SEC filing separately.
- **Similarity Top K**: This setting determines how many of similar chunks of data are sent to the LLM to solve the task.
- **LLM Provider**: Mainly choose `groq` or `openai` for providing LLM model. HuggingFace support is not recommended because larger models are generally not available.
- **LLM Model**: The LLM to be used for the agents in the crew and the query engines. The default is `llama3-8b-8192` from `groq`.
- **LLM Temperature**: This controls the randomness of an LLM. 0 is more deterministic, while 1 is more random.
- **LLM Max tokens**: Limit for the number of tokens to be generated by the LLM.
- **tickers_market_cap_exclude**: The market cap categories that are excluded from the `financedatabase` table for picking ticker.
